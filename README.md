# Official-Planet-Chili-Format
 The official Planet Chili coding format is here! Now you too can code ~~close enough to~~ *exactly* like Chili with this tool!

 ## Usage
 Just place the .clang-format file in your project's root directory and open the project in Visual Studio. Now the editor should auto format your code to the Chili Golden Standard!
 
 Note: You can use multiple .clang-format files that apply to different files in the project. When editing a file, Visual Studio uses the closest .clang-format file for formatting from the file's directory up to the project root directory.
